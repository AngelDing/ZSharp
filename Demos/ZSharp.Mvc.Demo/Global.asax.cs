            /* 5.If your ASP.NET application is using web services (WFC or ASMX) or System.Net to communicate 
             * with a backend over HTTP you may need to increase connectionManagement/maxconnection.  
             * For ASP.NET applications, this is limited to 12 * #CPUs by the autoConfig feature.  
             * This means that on a quad-proc, you can have at most 12 * 4 = 48 concurrent 
             * connections to an IP end point.  Because this is tied to autoConfig, the easiest way
             * to increase maxconnection in an ASP.NET application is to 
             * set System.Net.ServicePointManager.DefaultConnectionLimit programatically,
             * from Application_Start, for example.  Set the value to the number of concurrent 
             * System.Net connections you expect your application to use.  I've set this to Int32.MaxValue
             * and not had any side effects, so you might try that--this is actually the default used 
             * in the native HTTP stack, WinHTTP.  If you're not able to set 
             * System.Net.ServicePointManager.DefaultConnectionLimit programmatically, you'll
             * need to disable autoConfig , but that means you also need to set maxWorkerThreads and maxIoThreads. 
             * You won't need to set minFreeThreads or minLocalRequestFreeThreads if you're not using classic/ISAPI mode.
